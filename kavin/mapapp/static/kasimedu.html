      Kasimedu, located in North Chennai, is well known for its fishing harbour and 
      bustling fish market. Every morning, thousands of fishermen bring in their fresh 
      catch, making it one of the largest seafood hubs in Tamil Nadu. The harbour is 
      also home to hundreds of fishing boats and trawlers. Apart from being a major 
      livelihood centre, Kasimedu offers a glimpse into the vibrant life of the fishing 
      community and contributes significantly to the cityâ€™s seafood trade.
